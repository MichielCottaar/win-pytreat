    "# Jupyter notebook and IPython\n",
    "Our main interaction with python so far has been through the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "These notebooks are extremely popular these days within the python scientific community, however they support many more languages, such as R and octave (and even matlab with the right [plugin](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel)).\n",
    "They allow for interactive analysis of your data interspersed by explanatory notes (including LaTeX) with inline plotting.\n",
    "However, they can not be called as scripts on the command line or be imported from other python code, which makes them rather stand-alone.\n",
    "This makes them more useful for analysis that needs to be reproducible, but does not need to be replicated on different datasets (e.g., making a plot for a paper).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more ad-hoc analysis it can be useful to just use the command line (i.e., a REPL).\n",
    "We strongly recommend to use the IPython (available as `ipython` or `fslipython`) rather than default python REPL (available through `python` or `fslpython`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Ipython and the jupyter notebook offer a whole range of magic commands, which all start with a `%` sign.\n",
    "* A magic command starting with a single `%` sign will only affect the single line.\n",
    "* A magic command starting with two '%' signs will affect the whole block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the normal python interpreter will not understand these magic commands, so you will have to take them out when writing a python script or library.\n",
