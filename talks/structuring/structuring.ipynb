    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are writing code that you are sure will never be seen or used by\n",
    "anybody else, then you can structure your project however you want, and you\n",
    "can stop reading now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are intending to make your code available for others to use,\n",
    "you will make their lives easier if you spend a little time organising your\n",
    "project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python project directory should, at the very least, have a structure that\n",
    "resembles the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">   myproject/\n",
    ">       mypackage/\n",
    ">           __init__.py\n",
    ">           mymodule.py\n",
    ">       README\n",

    ">       setup.py\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `mypackage/` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you should do is make sure that all of your python code is\n",
    "organised into a sensibly-named\n",
    "[_package_](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/modules.html#packages). This\n",
    "is important, because it greatly reduces the possibility of naming collisions\n",
    "when people install your library alongside other libraries.  Hands up those of\n",
    "you who have ever written a file called `utils.[py|m|c|cpp]`!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the `advanced_topics/02_modules_and_packages.ipynb` practical for\n",
    "more details on packages in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## `README`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every project should have a README file. This is simply a plain text file\n",
    "which describes your project and how to use it. It is common and acceptable\n",
    "for a README file to be written in plain text,\n",
    "[reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html)\n",
    "(`README.rst`), or\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a LICENSE file makes it easy for people to understand the constraints\n",
    "under which your code can be used.\n",

    "## `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is not strictly necessary, but is very common in Python projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no strict rules for where to put your tests (you have tests,\n",
    "right?). There are two main conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can store your test files _inside_ your package directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> myproject/\n",
    ">     mypackage/\n",
    ">         __init__.py\n",
    ">         mymodule.py\n",
    ">         tests/\n",
    ">             __init__.py\n",
    ">             test_mymodule.py\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you can store your test files _alongside_ your package directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> myproject/\n",
    ">     mypackage/\n",
    ">         __init__.py\n",
    ">         mymodule.py\n",
    ">     tests/\n",
    ">         test_mymodule.py\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want your test code to be completely independent of your project's\n",
    "code, then go with the second option.  However, if you would like your test\n",
    "code to be distributed as part of your project (so that e.g. end users can run\n",
    "them), then the first option is probably the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the end, the standard Python unit testing frameworks\n",
    "([`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and\n",
    "[`nose`](http://nose2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) are pretty good at finding\n",
    "your test functions no matter where you've hidden them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are intending to make your project available for public use (e.g. on\n",
    "[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) and/or\n",
    "[conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo)), it is __very important__ to\n",
    "manage the version number of your project. If somebody decides to build their\n",
    "software on top of your project, they are not going to be very happy with you\n",
    "if you make substantial, API-breaking changes without changing your version\n",
    "number in an appropriate manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has [official standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) on\n",
    "what constitutes a valid version number. These standards can be quite\n",
    "complicated but, in the vast majority of cases, a simple three-number\n",
    "versioning scheme comprising _major_, _minor_, and _patch_ release\n",
    "numbers should suffice. Such a version number has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">     major.minor.patch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a version number of `1.3.2` has a _major_ release of 1, _minor_\n",
    "release of 3, and a _patch_ release of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you follow some simple and rational guidelines for versioning\n",
    "`your_project`, then people who use your project can, for instance, specify\n",
    "that they depend on `your_project==1.*`, and be sure that their code will work\n",
    "for _any_ version of `your_project` with a major release of 1. Following these\n",
    "simple guidelines greatly improves software interoperability, and makes\n",
    "everybody (i.e. developers of other projects, and end users) much happier!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern Python projects use some form of [_semantic\n",
    "versioning_](https://semver.org/). Semantic versioning is simply a set of\n",
    "guidelines on how to manage your version number:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - The _major_ release number should be incremented whenever you introduce any\n",
    "   backwards-incompatible changes. In other words, if you change your code\n",
    "   such that some other code which uses your code would break, you should\n",
    "   increment the major release number.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The _minor_ release number should be incremented whenever you add any new\n",
    "   (backwards-compatible) features to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The _patch_ release number should be incremented for backwards-compatible\n",

    "\n",
    "If you like to automate things,\n",
    "[`bumpversion`](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) is a simple tool that\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deprecate, don't remove!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really want to change your API, but can't bring yourself to increment\n",
    "your major release number, consider _deprecating_ the old API, and postponing\n",
    "its removal until you are ready for a major release. This will allow you to\n",
    "change your API, but retain backwards-compatilbiity with the old API until it\n",
    "can safely be removed at the next major release.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the built-in\n",
