    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run Python from a file**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This works just like it does in MATLAB:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put your code in a `.py` file (e.g. `mycode.py`).\n",
    "2. Run `fslpython mycode.py` in a terminal.\n",
    "3. ??\n",
    "4. Profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run python in an interpreter**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an [*interpreted\n",
    "language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language), like MATLAB.\n",
    "So you can either write your code into a file, and then run that file, or you\n",
    "can type code directly into a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",

    "Python has a standard interpreter built-in - run `fslpython` in a terminal,\n",
    "and see what happens (use CTRL+D to exit).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**But** there is another interpreter called [IPython](https://ipython.org/)\n",
    "which is vastly superior to the standard Python interpreter. Use IPython\n",
    "instead! It is already installed in `fslpython`, so if you want to do some\n",
