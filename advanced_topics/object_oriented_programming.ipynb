    "# Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you might have realised that __everything__ in Python is an\n",
    "object. Strings are objects, numbers are objects, functions are objects,\n",
    "modules are objects - __everything__ is an object!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But this does not mean that you have to use Python in an object-oriented\n",
    "fashion. You can stick with functions and statements, and get quite a lot\n",
    "done. But some problems are just easier to solve, and to reason about, when\n",
    "you use an object-oriented approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects versus classes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are versed in C++, Java, C#, or some other object-oriented language,\n",
    "then this should all hopefully sound familiar, and you can skip to the next\n",
    "section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not done any object-oriented programming before, your first step\n",
    "is to understand the difference between _objects_ (also known as _instances_)\n",
    "and _classes_ (also known as _types_).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some experience in C, then you can start off by thinking of a\n",
    "class as like a `struct` definition - it is a specification for the layout of\n",
    "a chunk of memory. For example, here is a typical struct definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> /**\n",
    ">  * Struct representing a stack.\n",
    ">  */\n",
    "> typedef struct __stack {\n",
    ">   uint8_t capacity; /**< the maximum capacity of this stack */\n",
    ">   uint8_t size;     /**< the current size of this stack     */\n",
    ">   void  **top;      /**< pointer to the top of this stack   */\n",
    "> } stack_t;\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, an _object_ is not a definition, but rather a thing which resides in\n",
    "memory. An object can have _attributes_ (pieces of information), and _methods_\n",
    "(functions associated with the object). You can pass objects around your code,\n",
    "manipulate their attributes, and call their methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our C metaphor, you can think of an object as like an\n",
    "instantiation of a struct:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> stack_t stack;\n",
    "> stack.capacity = 10;\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a `struct` in C, and a `class` in Python\n",
    "and other object oriented languages, is that you can't (easily) add functions\n",
    "to a `struct` - it is just a chunk of memory. Whereas in Python, you can add\n",
    "functions to your class definition, which will then be added as methods when\n",
    "you create an object from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are many more differences between C structs and classes (most\n",
    "notably [inheritance](todo), and [protection](todo)). But if you can\n",
    "understand the difference between a _definition_ of a C struct, and an\n",
    "_instantiation_ of that struct, then you are most of the way towards\n",
    "understanding the difference between a Python _class_, and a Python _object_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> But just to confuse you, remember that in Python, __everything__ is an\n",
    "> object - even classes!\n",
